<p>My name is Anna-Li! I am 20 years old and currently in my third year at GCU studying Mechanical Engineering Technology. 
I was born in and adopted from China and I live in Parker, Colorado. I love playing games and reading books. The quickest way to my heart
 is through sushi, boba, and cozy hoodies and blankets. I used to be a classically trained singer but now I just sing to the 
 radio in my car:)</p>
 <h2>chaos</h2>
<p>I wrote a song! It's about wanting to pursue a relationship with someone even though you know you could get hurt.
It was inspired by Taylor Swift's "Treacherous", and meant a lot to me as one of the first songs I ever wrote. If you like
acoustic pop ballads, I think you'll like the vibe of this song!</p>
